// flags describe the migration/write gates; activeQuitOperation joins a confirmed quit to the
// command that owns those flags.
//   - `preparing` drives the before-quit guard while target validation and durable handoff preparation
//     await, without closing the write gate before a copy is ready to start.
//   - `copying`  drives the before-quit guard: true only while runDataRootMigration is actively copying.
//   - `pending`  drives the write-gate: true from the moment the copy starts until the switch is
//     committed (and the app relaunches) or the copy is cancelled/discarded. It stays true across the
//     copy→commit window — the exact interval during which a prompt or notebook cell writing to the
//     OLD root would be silently discarded by the commit's delete step.
