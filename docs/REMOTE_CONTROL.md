# Remote Control Setup

Open-Science can expose the workspace running on your home or office computer to a phone, tablet, or another computer. Projects, agents, files, and notebook runtimes continue to run on the host computer; the remote device only displays and controls the Open-Science web interface.

Remote control uses the separately installed [Remote.It](https://www.remote.it/download) desktop and mobile applications. Open-Science does not bundle Remote.It, create a Remote.It account, or sign in for you.

## Before you begin

You need:

- Open-Science running on the computer that stores your projects.
- The Remote.It desktop application installed on that computer.
- A Remote.It account signed in on the desktop application.
- For App access, the Remote.It mobile application signed in to the same account.

The host computer must remain powered on, connected to the internet, and running both Open-Science and the Remote.It agent.

## 1. Add the host computer to Remote.It

This is a one-time account authorization step.

1. Open the Remote.It desktop application and sign in.
2. Select the **+** button.
3. Choose **This system**.
4. Confirm **Add Device**.
5. Return to Open-Science.

Open-Science cannot reuse the desktop application's sign-in token to authorize this Device automatically. After the Device has been added once, Open-Science can create and maintain its own services.

## 2. Open Remote

In Open-Science, open:

**Settings → Remote**

The page offers three modes:

| Mode               | Best for                                                         | Verification                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Off**            | Local use only                                                   | Remote requests are blocked by Open-Science.                                                  |
| **App access**     | Regular access from the signed-in Remote.It mobile app           | Every new browser session completes Open-Science two-step verification with a six-digit code. |
| **Browser access** | Access from any modern browser using a persistent URL or QR code | Every new browser completes Open-Science two-step verification with a six-digit code.         |

The two remote modes use separate managed services:

- **Open-Science Remote** is the private App access service.
- **System Service** supplies the persistent public Browser access URL.

Keeping these services separate prevents Browser access from changing the behavior of the private App connection.

## 3. Enable App access

1. Select **App access**.
2. If Open-Science reports that setup is incomplete, select **Detect again**.
3. Approve the operating-system prompt if service creation or repair requires administrator access.
4. Wait until the page reports **Connected**.
5. Open the Remote.It mobile app and sign in to the same account.
6. Select the host computer, then select **Open-Science Remote**.
7. Select **Connect** or **Launch**.
8. Compare the six-digit code with the request shown in **Pairing requests**.
9. Approve the request from the Open-Science desktop window or an already trusted browser.
10. Choose **Allow for up to 12 hours** for temporary access or **Trust this browser for 180 days** for later visits to the same remote address.

Remote.It account access opens the private route, but it is not an Open-Science credential. The six-digit confirmation prevents a local process from impersonating that route with forged HTTP headers.

## 4. Enable Browser access

1. Select **Browser access**.
2. If needed, select **Detect again** and approve the operating-system prompt.
3. Wait until the page reports **Connected** and shows the persistent browser link.
4. Open the link with **Open**, copy it to another device, or scan the displayed QR code.
5. On the new browser, compare its six-digit code with the request shown in **Pairing requests**.
6. Approve the request from the Open-Science desktop window or from an already trusted browser.
7. Choose **Allow for up to 12 hours** for temporary access or **Trust this browser for 180 days** for later visits to the same remote address.

Browser trust belongs to the browser profile, not to the physical device. Private browsing, cleared site data, a different browser, or a different browser profile requires verification again.

### Manage trusted browsers

The **Trusted browsers** section lists browser profiles trusted for 180 days through either remote mode. Revoke an entry to deny it on its next HTTP request or WebSocket reconnect.

The **Pairing requests** section lists browsers currently waiting for two-step verification. Approve only when the six-digit code matches the code on the requesting browser.

## Switch modes or turn access off

- Switching between **App access** and **Browser access** reuses the existing managed services whenever they are healthy.
- Select **Off** to block remote access locally. Open-Science keeps the provider configuration so a later restart does not needlessly recreate services.
- Closing Open-Science, shutting down the host computer, or losing the host network connection makes the workspace unavailable remotely.

## Troubleshooting

### Remote.It is installed but Open-Science says sign-in is required

Open the Remote.It desktop application, finish signing in, and select **Detect again**.

### Open-Science asks you to add a Device

In Remote.It, choose **+ → This system → Add Device** once. Do not use a claim code for the host computer. Return to Open-Science and select **Detect again**; Open-Science will create both managed services automatically.

### Setup asks for administrator approval

Administrator approval is requested only when an Open-Science service must be created or repaired. Repeated mode switches should reuse the healthy services and should not recreate them.

### The provider is still switching its background service mode

Wait a few seconds, then select **Detect again**. Do not add the Device again and do not create a service manually.

### App access opens the wrong service

Select **Open-Science Remote** in the mobile app. **System Service** is reserved for Browser access.

### Remote access shows a verification page again

The browser profile is not currently trusted. Complete the six-digit verification, or verify that cookies and site data were not cleared.

### The remote page loads slowly or stays blank

Keep Open-Science and the Remote.It agent running on the host, verify that the host has a stable network connection, then reconnect or refresh. If the problem continues, return to **Settings → Remote** and select **Detect again** for the active mode.

## Security notes

- App access relies on the signed-in Remote.It account and the private service created for Open-Science, then requires Open-Science's own browser verification before workspace access.
- Browser access publishes a persistent endpoint and uses the same secure-cookie, trusted-browser, and revocation controls.
- Provider `Host` and `Origin` headers identify an expected route but never authenticate a request.
- Do not share a browser pairing code with another person.
- Revoke browsers you no longer use.
- Select **Off** when remote access is not needed.
