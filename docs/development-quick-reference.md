# AIPOCH Open-Science — Development & Packaging

AIPOCH Open-Science has an ordinary Node backend and an Electron desktop client, built with React, TypeScript, Prisma/SQLite, and an ACP-based agent runtime.

Prerequisites for source development:

- Node.js 24 (see [`.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc)) with npm
- Git
- Notebook execution optionally uses app-managed Python/R environments or a compatible interpreter you configure.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aipoch/open-science.git
cd open-science
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm install` automatically generates the Prisma client and installs Electron native dependencies. `npm run dev` builds the shared Node backend, stages its pinned executable, builds the Electron main/preload bundles, starts the renderer, and opens the desktop client. Development data is isolated under `~/.open-science-project`.

Useful commands:

Packaged output is written under `dist/`.

[README](../README.md)

`npm run build:backend` builds the Node entry; `npm run pack:backend` builds the target-specific
standalone package. See [standalone runtime](standalone-runtime.md) for prerequisites and boundaries.
