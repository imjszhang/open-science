# Notebook process sandbox

This private package is the Open-Science-owned process boundary for local Notebook, REPL, Notebook
Bash, and `manage_packages` installer processes. Its low-level runtime remains private; application
code crosses only the `NotebookProcessSandbox` adapter in
`src/main/notebook/process-sandbox.ts`.

## Scope

The package provides:

- forced network routing on macOS and Linux, plus optional protected routing on Windows;
- exact-domain, wildcard-domain, and optional port allow/deny rules;
- a per-process callback for an application-owned “allow this destination?” interaction;
- live policy updates without restarting the proxy;
- command wrapping, denial annotations, readiness checks, and cleanup;
- write-deny-by-default filesystem access with sensitive user roots hidden unless declared;
- host-environment projection that excludes credentials and process hooks by default;
- one validated CA bundle shared by Notebook clients and HTTPS parent-proxy connections;
- explicit Windows setup for the Notebook AppContainer and its fenced loopback gateway access;
- ownership-tracked, idempotent Windows removal for uninstall and repair.

The implementation contains no generic configuration loader, user credential injection, AWS
signing, TLS interception, or request-body inspection.

The public `@aipoch/notebook-network-sandbox/execution-confinement` subpath exposes only the pure
execution-ceiling normalizer and host-membership predicate. CommonJS recovery processes and ESM
callers share one implementation without loading the sandbox owner. Membership never grants network
access: the ordinary destination policy must still approve a request, and offline execution denies
every host. Runtime wrapping and lifecycle operations remain behind the process adapter.

```

Callers provide a minimal environment, read/write roots, protected roots, packaged resources, and
one network-decision callback per command. Proxy lifecycle, command attribution, platform
enforcement, parent-proxy routing, filesystem projection, and denial annotation stay inside the
module.

Policy is evaluated in this order:

1. malformed hosts and explicit deny rules are rejected;
2. all DNS answers are resolved. Non-public destinations require an exact trusted private-service
   rule for that hostname and port, with every answer still in its reviewed address set;
3. enabled built-in groups and custom public domains allow ordinary public requests. Turning off a
   built-in rule requires approval; it does not create a hard deny, and an exact custom grant can
   override it;
4. unknown public destinations can use the gateway's restricted HTTPS GET/HEAD path on port 443
   during an active execution. Request bodies, authentication/custom headers and other methods
   require broader approval. Explicit-ask rules do not receive that read exception;
5. the Agent may call `request_network_access` for public access. An approved one-time grant is
   consumed by the next matching execution; an always grant is persisted and hot-applied.

“Allow once” and “Always allow” never bypass address validation or create private-service grants.
A stored public hostname is not proof of DNS eligibility, connectivity, credentials or TLS trust.

### Trusted private services

Only the local Settings flow can review and save private services. Review resolves DNS without
connecting to the service. The user sees the hostname, exact port, IP addresses and installation-wide
permission to send data before adding the rule to the draft. Save resolves new or changed rules again;
changed answers require another review. Concurrent private editors use a baseline check, while public
allowlist updates retain their existing delta merge. Removing a rule works offline. Policy changes
reset active gateway connections and invalidate pending decisions.

Eligible addresses are RFC 1918 IPv4 and IPv6 unique-local service addresses, excluding current host
interfaces and AWS's IPv6 metadata address `fd00:ec2::254`. Loopback, link-local/metadata, CGNAT,
multicast, transition encodings, literal IP inputs, wildcard hosts and unrestricted ports remain
unsupported. Every new connection checks every DNS answer; a subset of the reviewed set is accepted,
but any new, public, reserved or host-interface answer rejects the private exception. Connections,
including parent-proxy tunnels, use the validated numeric address. A private rule does not implicitly
allow the hostname if it later resolves publicly; normal public policy applies instead.

Settings persists the optional `notebookNetwork.trustedPrivateDestinations` array as
`{ hostname, port, approvedAddresses }` in the existing local `settings.json` transaction. Missing
means no private grants. Existing public entries are never promoted; no database migration or settings
version bump is required. Session packages and data-folder relocation do not transfer Settings.
Manually copying the whole configuration also copies its trust grants: review or remove private
rules before using that configuration on another machine/network. This is address-set trust, not
cryptographic service identity; HTTPS certificate checks still apply, and raw TCP/HTTP services
remain the user's explicit trust decision.

Private rules do not authorize conversation-link previews/icons, model endpoints, Connectors, remote
Compute hosts or agent-native tools outside the application-owned execution boundary. Rules do not
enable Windows protection; standard execution remains outside enforcement until protection is set up.

## Security behavior

Every wrapped process supplies its own `onNetworkAccessRequest` callback. Unknown destinations are
denied unless that live process's callback resolves to `true`; missing, completed, cancelled, and
unattributed processes fail closed. The application owns whether approval means allow once or add to
the Network Domain allowlist.

Each wrapped process receives random HTTP Basic/SOCKS5 credentials for the shared Windows gateway
or its own macOS/Linux gateway. Separate processes cannot reuse one another's approval context.
Persistent-kernel cells share one OS process and therefore one credential principal; their
allow-once grants are activated only for the selected runtime's next execution, but background work
inside that same kernel is intentionally part of the same principal. Missing or incorrect
credentials are rejected before policy evaluation. Denied authenticated proxy requests
return an HTTP 403 or the equivalent SOCKS failure. `wrap()` returns a process
handle whose `annotateStderr(stderr)` appends a structured `<sandbox_violations>` block containing the
blocked destination and whose idempotent `cleanup()` cancels pending approvals. The command
correlation identifier remains private to the package.

Host home directories and common mounted-user-data roots are private by default. Notebook session roots, the current working
directory, user-granted roots, runtime binaries, executable search paths, temporary paths, and a
configured CA bundle are projected with explicit read-only or read/write access. Each command gets
its own application-created temporary directory instead of inheriting the host temporary directory.
macOS enforces the
policy with Seatbelt, Linux with bubblewrap mounts, and Windows with a per-command ACL
lease for the Notebook AppContainer. Permission errors receive a structured violation that
directs the user to grant the folder in the Files view and retry.

Notebook child environments start from an allowlist. Provider tokens, cloud credentials,
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, and other arbitrary host variables do not cross the process seam. A configured
complete PEM trust bundle is exposed only through the standard native client variables and is also
used to verify an HTTPS parent proxy. Leaving it blank uses public/system roots.

Only one `NotebookNetworkSandbox` instance may own the platform sandbox at a time. Each wrapped
command gets a credential-isolated proxy context whose server-side closure binds the approval to
that command. Commands may run concurrently on every supported platform.
Call `dispose()` during lifecycle shutdown.

## Platform setup

- macOS uses the built-in Seatbelt mechanism for network and filesystem policy.
- Linux uses bubblewrap to create a private network, PID, user, IPC, UTS, and mount namespace. It
  exposes an application-created gateway socket plus the exact Notebook RPC socket when the REPL
  needs Host SDK access, and runs a small bridge with the application's own Node-compatible
  executable inside the namespace. The remaining host `/run` and `/tmp` socket spaces are hidden,
  so there is no second host-network path and no `socat` dependency. Debian packages
  declare `bubblewrap`; AppImage users receive an actionable setup message when it is missing.
- Windows starts in standard mode: Notebook processes receive the authenticated proxy environment,
  but applications that ignore proxy variables are not a security boundary. An explicit Settings
  action enables protected mode. Short-lived package installers are additionally contained by the
  bundled host's kill-on-close Job Object in standard mode, without changing that mode's network or
  filesystem guarantees. Protected mode launches commands in a capability-free AppContainer
  and installs Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) filters scoped to that AppContainer SID. The filters
  permit only TCP to the installation-owned authenticated gateway on `127.0.0.1`; all other IPv4 and
  IPv6 connect attempts from the AppContainer are blocked. Concurrent commands share that listener
  and are routed by random per-command credentials. A conflicting port is reported as setup-required,
  and setup rotates the receipt and WFP fence to a newly available port.
  The bundled `notebook-appcontainer-host.exe` creates the
  process with `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES`, grants temporary ACL access to the
  declared roots, and contains the process tree in a kill-on-close Job Object. Writable roots with
  protected descendants are split into allow-only ACL segments: ordinary subtrees receive modify
  access, protected files and directories remain read-only, and their ancestor boundaries omit
  delete-child access. A creation journal
  and ownership receipt under the original desktop user's
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aipoch\Open-Science\notebook-sandbox\<installationId>\` make setup recoverable.
  Existing ownership records under `Aipoch\OpenScience` stay in place; conflicting old and new records block initialization and uninstall. Explicit `OPEN_SCIENCE_CONFIG_ROOT` keeps task ownership records under that isolated root.
  The desktop process passes that root explicitly across UAC, so elevation with another
  administrator account cannot redirect ownership state into the administrator profile.
  The stable installation identity is independent of the selected install directory, so a moved
  update and its later uninstaller address the same receipt and resources. Windows ships only as a
  current-user NSIS package because AppContainer profiles are per-user resources; a portable ZIP or
  machine-wide installation would make complete, ownership-proven uninstall impossible.
  The receipt binds the installation identity, a random ownership token, the token-suffixed
  AppContainer profile, and the exact WFP sublayer/filter GUIDs. Per-command ACL lease receipts in the
  same directory allow the next launch/setup or uninstall to recover grants after a host crash.
  `removeWindows()` and the NSIS uninstaller stop owned processes, recover ACL leases, remove only
  the receipt's loopback/WFP resources, and delete the profile idempotently. Resources without
  a valid scoped receipt are preserved.

`status()` never elevates privileges or changes durable setup resources. When a receipt appears
active, it launches short-lived positive and negative connection probes before reporting protected
mode. Missing Windows setup leaves the runtime in standard mode; first Notebook use never prompts.
Only an explicit call to `installWindows()` may display a UAC prompt. A cancelled or failed setup
leaves standard mode available. Successful setup affects new Notebook and package-manager processes;
already-running sessions retain their original mode. `removeWindows()` uses the same explicit
elevation behavior, stops protected AppContainer processes, removes only ownership-proven resources,
and returns future launches to standard mode.

Managed and external R kernels can start in Windows standard mode without administrator setup.
Their authenticated gateway remains active, but software that ignores proxy settings is not isolated.
R admission checks the native ownership receipt and pending operations: an absent setup permits
standard execution, while incomplete, damaged, or unreadable protection does not. The admission
decision is checked again before launch; a protected R request never falls back to standard mode.
Settings mutations in the same owner process invalidate prepared R launches until the executor
synchronously starts the owned process tree. Already-started trees retain their selected mode;
this check does not coordinate mutations from other processes.
Protected mode retains its separate R runtime-access authorization. This decision is transient and
does not add a setting or change the ownership receipt format.

Packaged callers pass `join(process.resourcesPath, 'notebook-network-sandbox')` as `resources.root`.
Development callers point it at this package's `vendor` directory.

## Native host builds

Only Windows needs a bundled native host. Build one architecture explicitly so the output lands in
the resource path used by the application:

```bash
node vendor/windows/build.mjs x64
node vendor/windows/build.mjs arm64
```

Windows native builds use Cargo/MSVC; cross-builds use `cargo-xwin`. The host is a standalone native
executable and adds no Java, JAR, account credential, or application runtime dependency.
