# Credential identity metadata probe

This standalone executable checks an allowlisted application name against macOS file-keychain
metadata. Importing the package only returns `executablePath`. The caller must run it as a separate
process with a timeout, bounded stdout, and no shell; never embed its Security API calls in Electron.

The argument is one of `Open Science`, `Open Science (DEV)`, `Open-Science`, or
`Open-Science (DEV)`. It writes one JSON result with `schemaVersion`, `platform`, `identity`,
`status`, `reason`, `osStatus`, and an `account` only for `exists`. Status is one of `exists`,
`not-found`, `access-blocked`, `error`, or `unsupported`. Windows and Linux return `unsupported`.
The macOS implementation applies to non-MAS Electron builds only.

## Windows existing-key validation

`validatorExecutablePath` resolves the separate `credential_key_validator` executable. This is an
explicit secret-read phase, not a metadata probe. Its Windows stdin must contain 1–65,536 binary
bytes of an existing DPAPI ciphertext, after the caller removes Chromium's `DPAPI` prefix. It does
not parse base64 or read Local State itself.

The validator calls only `CryptUnprotectData` with `CRYPTPROTECT_UI_FORBIDDEN`, accepts exactly a
32-byte decrypted key, and clears the complete returned buffer with `SecureZeroMemory` before
`LocalFree` on success and failure. Windows stdin is switched to binary mode. It neither generates
keys nor re-protects or persists data. Stdout contains only `schemaVersion`, `platform`, `status`,
`reason`, and `errorCode`; status is `valid`, `access-blocked`, `error`, or `unsupported`. Other
platforms return `unsupported`.

The caller supplies timeout and output limits and must block initialization when existing protected
history cannot be validated. A successful key check does not establish that all historical
application ciphertexts can be decrypted; the caller separately verifies that inventory.

[Microsoft's CryptUnprotectData contract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dpapi/nf-dpapi-cryptunprotectdata)
documents the no-UI flag and returned-buffer cleanup requirements.

## Safety boundary

- Disable Keychain interaction process-wide, read back that setting, and restore its previous value.
  A failed disable, readback, or restore fails closed. Query-level UI suppression alone does not work
  for file-based Keychains.
- Copy the complete current search list and require readable Keychains with available status.
  Re-copy the list and compare its order and statuses after each lookup and ownership check.
  Changes fail closed. Do not omit locked Keychains from the query.
- Request attributes and a temporary item reference, with data and persistent references explicitly
  disabled. Use `SecKeychainItemCopyKeychain` only to establish the item's owning database; never
  serialize the reference, owner, or returned attributes. Search the exact service and account,
  return at most two matches, and reject observed duplicates or malformed results. No Keychain
  create, update, delete, unlock, password-read, or OSCrypt API is used.
- With a locked Keychain present, accept a positive match only when its owner is the first Keychain
  in the unchanged search list and that owner is unlocked. This establishes Electron's first-match
  reading owner, not global uniqueness: a later locked database may hide another item, but cannot
  precede this owner. Any observed duplicate still blocks the result. A locked owner or a later owner
  returns `keychain-search-incomplete`; this deliberately conservative case requires recovery.
- A not-found result with any locked Keychain is uncertain (`keychain-locked`), never absence.
  In particular, the helper cannot query the bare account without establishing suffixed-account
  absence. Application-name selection is a separate policy: the caller may probe another name and
  select a confirmed identity, but must retain inventory and actual-access guards. An uncertain
  selected identity is not permission to create a replacement. Unlock the relevant original
  Keychains and retry; do not remove keys or retry failed secret access under another identity.
- Follow Electron's account precedence: `<name> Key` first; only `errSecItemNotFound` permits querying
  `<name>`. An access failure never triggers a fallback. No returned attributes are copied to stdout.

`exists` proves only a metadata match at the time of inspection. It does not prove password access,
ACL approval, decryption success, or that system state will remain unchanged. A legacy bare-account
match can cause Electron itself to copy the key into the suffixed account on its later first real
use; this probe does not perform that operation. MAS builds use a different suffix and are not covered.

## Version evidence

The application lockfile currently resolves Electron 39.8.10 / Chromium 142.0.7444.265. Its relevant
Electron startup and account-suffix patch were also compared with Electron 39.2.6:

- [Electron startup timing](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v39.8.10/shell/browser/electron_browser_main_parts.cc):
  `PostCreateMainMessageLoop` snapshots the application name for macOS and Linux OSCrypt.
- [Electron account suffix patch](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v39.8.10/patches/chromium/feat_ensure_mas_builds_of_the_same_application_can_use_safestorage.patch):
  suffixed account first, bare-account fallback, and legacy key copy.
- [Chromium file-Keychain interaction guard](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/142.0.7444.226/crypto/apple/keychain.cc):
  file-based Keychains require `SecKeychainSetUserInteractionAllowed` (FB16959400).
- [Chromium metadata/secret query implementation](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/142.0.7444.226/crypto/apple/keychain_secitem.mm):
  OSCrypt's real lookup requests password data and must never serve as a metadata probe.
- [Apple's macOS query/result implementation](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Security/blob/db15acbe6a7f257a859ad9a3bb86097bfe0679d9/OSX/libsecurity_keychain/lib/SecItem.cpp#L3132):
  numeric match limits are supported; a limit greater than one returns an array even for one match.
- [Apple file-keychain cursor](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Security/blob/db15acbe6a7f257a859ad9a3bb86097bfe0679d9/OSX/libsecurity_keychain/lib/KCCursor.cpp):
  databases are traversed in search-list order; some database failures are skipped. Consequently,
  query success or not-found alone cannot certify a complete search through locked databases.
- [Apple item ownership query](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Security/blob/db15acbe6a7f257a859ad9a3bb86097bfe0679d9/OSX/libsecurity_keychain/lib/SecKeychainItem.cpp#L228):
  copying the owning Keychain uses the item's metadata, without retrieving its secret.

## Verification

`npm test --prefix packages/credential-identity-probe-native` on macOS compiles and executes a
fixture with injected fake Security APIs. It also compiles and links the production helper without
running it. Fixtures exercise the actual query construction, return classification, fallback, and
interaction restoration. They do not inspect real credentials or prove live Keychain behavior.
The separate CryptoAPI fixture verifies Windows-key validation logic and zeroization with injected
functions on macOS/Linux. The Windows API adapter and Crypt32 linkage require Windows validation;
compiling the non-Windows executable is not evidence of a Windows run.

Run tests through the task's approved isolated configuration runner. Real-helper execution and
real-Keychain integration checks require a separately authorized test environment.

## Standalone Node secret helper

`secretExecutablePath` identifies `credential_secret`, a separate secret-access executable used
only by the Node host. Build it with `npm run build:backend-native`; ordinary desktop builds keep
only the existing metadata probe and validator targets. On Linux this target requires libsecret
and libdbus development headers plus pkg-config.

After the shared identity/inventory preflight has permitted access, the helper reads the selected
macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service/KWallet key, or protects/unprotects Windows data using DPAPI.
Creation is explicit and serialized by the entry's credential bootstrap lease. Secret bytes travel
only on bounded private stdio pipes; failures are sanitized and never trigger a plaintext fallback.
This does not change the metadata probe's read-only contract above.

The Node cipher is pinned to Electron 43.7.5's
[OSCrypt sync implementation](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v43.7.5/patches/chromium/revert_oscrypt_remove_sync_backend.patch).
See [compatibility and persistent-state notes](../../docs/standalone-runtime.md#historical-compatibility)
before changing its format or selected OS identity.
